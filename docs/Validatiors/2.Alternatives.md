# Alternative solutions

Before choosing Substrate we have studied a number of alternative options searching for an optimal for the team, while meeting the requirements of the project. The solution had to be distributed, had to allow addition of new validators in a decentralized way. The signature must involve most but not nessessarily all the signors allowing space for malicious or off-line nodes.

## 1. EVM

</center>

EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) is a decentralized protocol for executing smart contracts on the Ethereum network. While it has played a pivotal role in the blockchain ecosystem, it has faced challenges in terms of protocol security breaches. These vulnerabilities within the EVM's core node code have led to significant incidents in the past, posing risks to the stability and security of the network.

### 1.1 Security Breaches

</center>

The Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) has experienced notable security breaches in the past, with each incident highlighting the vulnerabilities within the EVM protocol. These include the infamous "DAO Attack" in 2016, where an attacker exploited a vulnerability in the DAO smart contract code, leading to a contentious hard fork in the Ethereum network. Additionally, the "Parity Multisig Wallet Bug" of 2017 resulted in the loss of millions of dollars due to a critical flaw in the Parity wallet's smart contract.

### 1.2. Not modular

<center>

<img src="/img/validators/cube.png" alt="Substrate"  width="150px"/>

</center>

One primary reason for rejecting the use of EVM in our XP.NETWORK NFT bridge project is the lack of modularity in EVM nodes. EVM nodes are not inherently designed to be modular, making it challenging to customize and adapt them to our specific project requirements. This lack of modularity can limit the flexibility and efficiency of our node implementation.

### 1.3. Poor development documentaiton

<center>

<img src="/img/validators/docs.png" alt="Substrate"  width="150px"/>

</center>

Furthermore, the decision to opt for Substrate over EVM is also influenced by the issue of poor [development](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/nodes-and-clients/) documentation within the EVM ecosystem. Inadequate documentation can impede the development process, increase the learning curve for developers, and lead to potential errors or inefficiencies in the implementation of our decentralized node infrastructure.

## 2. Solana

<center>

<img src="/img/validators/solana.png" alt="Substrate"  width="150px"/>

</center>

Solana nodes offer a robust framework for achieving decentralized consensus; however, there is a notable limitation in the Solana network, where a maximum of seven nodes can participate in the voting process at any given time. 

### 2.1 Security Breaches

<center>

<img src="/img/validators/security_breach.jpg" alt="Substrate"  width="150px" class="round-corner-20"/>

</center>

In August 2022, an attack on the Solana blockchain led to the compromise of over 7,700 software wallets, including users of Slope, Phantom, Solflare, and Trust Wallet, resulting in losses of approximately $5.2 million in SOL, NFTs, and various Solana-based tokens. The attack's precise method, suspected to involve a private key compromise, is under investigation, with potential vulnerabilities in wallet software, such as supply chain attacks, browser zero-day flaws, or faulty random number generators, being considered as contributing factors. Nonce reuse bugs are also under scrutiny as a possible cause for the compromise of private keys.

### 2.2. Not modular

<center>

<img src="/img/validators/cube.png" alt="Substrate"  width="150px"/>

</center>

One of the notable limitations of the Solana node implementation is its lack of modularity. Unlike some other blockchain networks that offer a modular architecture where self-consistent packages can be easily added or removed from a core node, Solana's node architecture is more monolithic in nature. This means that making structural changes or customizations to the node can be relatively complex and inflexible. 

### 2.3. Poor development documentaiton

<center>

<img src="/img/validators/docs.png" alt="Substrate"  width="150px"/>

</center>

Developing on the Solana network can be challenging due to the lack of comprehensive and well-structured documentation for node developers. The absence of clear and detailed documentation can make it difficult for developers to navigate the existing code base, add new features, or tailor the node to suit specific use cases. This deficiency in documentation not only increases the learning curve for developers but also hampers the efficiency of development efforts.


## 3. EOS

EOS is a blockchain platform renowned for its capabilities as a framework for building decentralized applications and custom blockchains. Its technological stack features a delegated proof-of-stake (DPoS) consensus algorithm, which prioritizes scalability and high transaction throughput, making it suitable for enterprise-grade applications. EOS provides a web-based toolkit for smart contract development, EOSIO, and uses the C++ programming language. It boasts a few significant advantages, including rapid transaction processing, low latency, and feeless transactions, which make it an appealing choice for applications requiring real-time interactions.

### 3.1 Security Breaches

<center>

<img src="/img/validators/security_breach.jpg" alt="Substrate"  width="150px" class="round-corner-20"/>

</center>

EOS has experienced significant security breaches, with EOSBet, a gambling decentralized application (dApp), falling victim to two notable hacks. The first hack occurred on October 15, 2018, resulting in the loss of at least $338,000 in EOS tokens, followed by a similar attack in September 2018. Other EOS-based dApps like DEOS and EOS.WIN faced similar issues. These hacks were possible due to vulnerabilities in how EOS contracts interacted with the eosio.token contract. By exploiting a bug in the dispatch transfer function, hackers could send tokens from one account to another, and the recipient contract would mistakenly process it as a legitimate transaction from eosio.token. This allowed malicious actors to manipulate the system and execute unauthorized actions. The lack of proper validation and documentation for handling such transfers within EOS contracts contributed to these vulnerabilities and their exploitation. However, the need for significant computational resources to run EOS nodes may be a barrier for some participants.

### 3.2. Small development community

<center>

<img src="/img/validators/community.jpg" alt="Substrate"  width="150px" class="round-corner-20"/>

</center>

EOS has grappled with the challenge of maintaining a relatively small developer community, which can be a significant obstacle when creating complex systems like new consensus mechanisms. The intricacies of developing and fine-tuning innovative consensus mechanisms often require expertise and experience. Developers encounter difficulties in seeking assistance or troubleshooting issues due to the limited developer base. Smaller communities also result in slower response times for problem resolution and hinder the collaborative development of robust consensus protocols.

### 3.3. Centralized

<center>

<img src="/img/validators/centralized.jpg" alt="Substrate"  width="250px" class="round-corner-20"/>

</center>

EOS has faced criticism for its perceived centralization due to several factors. One key point of contention is its delegated proof-of-stake (DPoS) consensus mechanism, which relies on a relatively small number of elected block producers (21 in the mainnet) responsible for validating transactions and maintaining the network. This limited number of block producers raises concerns about the concentration of power and decision-making among a select few, potentially undermining the blockchain's decentralization ideals. Additionally, EOS's governance model has been criticized for lacking transparency and inclusivity, with decisions made by a small group of token holders. These factors have fueled the criticism that EOS may not be as decentralized as some other blockchain networks, as governance and validation power can become concentrated in the hands of a few entities.
