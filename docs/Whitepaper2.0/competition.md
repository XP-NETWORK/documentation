# Competition and advantages

Competitive landscape
Cross-chain bridging is one of the most active areas of blockchain development at the moment, but few projects focus on NFT bridges. Even those that do support only a limited number of chains. The most prominent existing solutions include:

| Project| Supported chains	| Live |
| :-------------: |:-------------:| :-----:|
|AnySwap	| Ethereum & Fantom	| Testnet only|
PolyBridge |	Ethereum, BSC, HECO, Palette, OKExChain & Polygon |	Yes
Efinity	| Ethereum & Enjin (a Polkadot parachain) |	No
Solana Wormhole |	Ethereum, Solana |	Yes
NFT OmniBridge |	xDAI, Ethereum |	Early beta
SeaScape	| BSC, Moonbeam, Rinkeby testnet |	Yes


## Advantages

Compared to all the bridging solutions described above, XP.network has a number of important advantages:

1) The first bridge designed exclusively for NFTs, tackling every aspect of asset transition and compatibility across multiple protocols;<br/>
2) A much wider range of supported blockchains: any chain can be connected to the bridge;<br/>
3) Linking EVM to a range of non-EVM chains with fundamentally different tech stacks, such as Elrond, Solana, Cardano, Algorand, etc.<br/>
4) A simple and seamless UI for minting, transfering, and exploring NFTs;<br/>
5) Attractively low transaction fees, payable in the currency of the origin blockchain (ETH, BNB, SOL etc.);<br/>
6) Highly scalable: the capacity of the bridge is limited only by the TPS of the bridged chains;<br/>
7) Possibility to mint NFTs on multiple chains from an easy-to-use UI;<br/>
8) Superior security and reliability: a multilayer security system capable of preventing all common types of attacks, with no single points of failure;<br/>
9) A more versatile technological stack, and provide the same level of security and reliability;<br/>
10) Possibility to integrate the bridge with any NFT dApp, allowing users to trade and exchange NFTs the way they are used to, while the bridge operates behind the scenes.<br/>
