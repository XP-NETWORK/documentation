## 2. Minting Assignments

Currently, there are four minting assignments:

1. Minting 5 NFTs on Aurora. Reward: 25 points.
2. Minting 5 NFTs on BSC. Reward: 25 points.
3. Minting 5 NFTs on Moonbeam. Reward: 25 points.
4. Minting 5 NFTs on Polygon. Reward: 25 points.

To meet the 25 points reward requirements, mint exactly 5 NFTs in one of the available chains. You are not limited to one chain only. You can mint on all four chains and get 25 points each time you mint 5 NFTs.

### 2.1. To start minting,

<center>

![Minting Assignments](../../static/img/campaigns/aurora_galxe/2.minting_ui.png)

![Minting Assignments](../../static/img/campaigns/aurora_galxe/3.select_wallet.png)

</center>

<center>

![Minting Assignments](../../static/img/campaigns/aurora_galxe/4.mint_command.png)

</center>

6. Confirm the transaction in the wallet of your choice.

As you can see, the NFT contract does not charge you for minting. All you're paying is the blockchain transaction fee for saving the record of your ownership.

<center>

![Minting Assignments](../../static/img/campaigns/aurora_galxe/5.wallet_confirm.png)

</center>

7. Mint another NFT or bridge the minted one to another chain.

Remember that you need exactly five minted NFTs on a chain to get the 25 points reward.

## 3. Bridging NFTs

The campaign has multiple bridging assignments:

1. Bridge 1, 3 & 5 NFTs from Ethereum to Aurora and get 10, 30 & 50 points, correspondingly
2. Bridge 1, 3 & 5 NFTs from Moonbeam to Aurora and get 5, 15 & 30 points, correspondingly
3. Bridge 1, 3 & 5 NFTs from Polygon to Aurora and get 5, 15 & 30 points, correspondingly
4. Bridge 1, 3 & 5 NFTs from Solana to Aurora and get 5, 15 & 30 points, correspondingly
5. Bridge 1, 3 & 5 NFTs from Avalance to Aurora and get 5, 15 & 30 points, correspondingly
6. Bridge 1, 3 & 5 NFTs from Fantom to Aurora and get 5, 15 & 30 points, correspondingly

Mind that every next award already includes the previous award. For example, your 30 points for transferring 5 NFTs from Moonbeam to Aurora already include the reward of 15 points for bridging 3 NFTs and 5 points for bridging 1. But bridging 5 NFTs is better because you get a 5 points premium for completing this. Without this premium, you would get 25 points, 5 for each bridged NFT.
