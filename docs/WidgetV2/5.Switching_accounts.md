# Switching accounts on the same departure chain

In the first version of the widget, there was an issue with switching accounts without changing the blockchain of departure. A user switched the account in the browser extension, but the bridge kept displaying the assets of the initial account. This was caused by the inability of the Metamask wallet to properly interact with the `<iframe>` tag.

We have fixed the bug by adding the missing code. Now the `<iframe>` gets properly notified of the changes in Metamask.

## Step 1 - viewing the asstes

## Step 2 - switching accounts in Metamask

1. Open Metamask and select a different account
2. Click the `Connect` link for the selected account

## New structure

The new structure of the widget allows to establish communitcation between the browser extension and the iframe:

```html
<!-- 1. The wrapping tag of the widget -->
<div>
    <!-- 2. The iframe with the widget settings -->
    <iframe>
        ...
    </iframe>
    <!-- 3. The JavaScript code connecting Metamask & the iframe -->
    <script src='https://widget-staging.xp.network/wscript.js'>
    </script>
</div>
```

To conform with the security best practices, it is a good idea to protect the script link above with the unique [nonce](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/nonce) or add the JavaScript code of the widget to the rest of the trusted JS source code.
