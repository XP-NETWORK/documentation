# Registering the widget

Register your widget in the bridge before setting its parameters. During the registration process, a unique ID will be generated. The ID will mark the transactions as related to your project, which is required for proper royalties calculation.

## How to register
```
curl https://widget.xp.network/?widget=true&wsettings=true&wid=create
```

This will generate a key similar to this: `62d57f9085a8e0368a0bf7e1`

From now on, edit this widget using the key, unless you want to create a new widget.

## Accessing the widget with the key

```
curl https://widget.xp.network/?widget=true&wsettings=true&wid=62d57f9085a8e0368a0bf7e1
```
