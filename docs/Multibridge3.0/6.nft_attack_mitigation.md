# NFT Contract Security

<ReactPlayer className="introduction-player" controls url='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3mS8Q2UGY0=0s' />

A typical[^1] NFT smart contract is a self-sufficient piece of logic processing external inputs, changing its storage state, and outputting events or internal variables values. The contract has only five functionalities related to tokens:

1. **Minting** - token creation (usually requires a MINTER_ROLE)
2. **Burning** - token destruction (usually requires the owner's role)
3. **Transferring** - changing ownership of a token (usually requires the owner's role)
4. **Event emitting** - informing the subscribed entities of the token-related changes.
5. **Ownership records** - persistent storage

All the rest of the contract is responsible for the assets (NFTs) security. The contract's security comprises:
+ Access control and 
+ Protection from user mistakes.

An NFT Contract can be logically split into the following:

1. Storage - the global constants, variables, and hashmaps declarations
2. Constructor or an initializing function - the initial setters of the key storage values
3. Other functions that can be further divided by their visibility into:
   1. `external` - called from outside the contract, but not the contract itself
   2. `public` - the default setting letting anyone, including other contracts, call this function
   3. `private` - only visible by the contract itself
   4. `internal` - like private, but accessible by the contracts inheriting from this one

Functions can be further divided by whether they interact with the storage values. One type of function calls falls into the `read` category, known in conventional programming languages as getters. In Solidity, such functions are usually modified with the `view` keyword when a storage value is read without modification and the `pure` keyword when the output is calculated in the function body and has nothing to do with the storage. Even though the gas fee for processing such functions can be calculated, an external account controlled by a user is not charged for such requests. However, if contracts perform the same queries, they are charged the gas according to the yellow paper opcodes costs.

Out of 33 functions, an Openzeppelin ERC-721 implementation has 13 `view` and no `pure` functions:

```ts
// public = can be called by anyone
// returns (type) = specifies the return type of the funciton
// view = only reads form a slot, no writing permission
1. function supportsInterface(bytes4 interfaceId) public view virtual override(ERC165, IERC165) returns (bool)
2. function balanceOf(address owner) public view virtual override returns (uint256)
3. function ownerOf(uint256 tokenId) public view virtual override returns (address)
4. function name() public view virtual override returns (string memory)
5. function symbol() public view virtual override returns (string memory)
6. function tokenURI(uint256 tokenId) public view virtual override returns (string memory)
7. function getApproved(uint256 tokenId) public view virtual override returns (address)
8. function isApprovedForAll(address owner, address operator) public view virtual override returns (bool)
// internal = privatly inherited
9.  function _baseURI() internal view virtual returns (string memory)
10. function _ownerOf(uint256 tokenId) internal view virtual returns (address)
11. function _exists(uint256 tokenId) internal view virtual returns (bool)
12. function _isApprovedOrOwner(address spender, uint256 tokenId) internal view virtual returns (bool)
13. function _requireMinted(uint256 tokenId) internal view virtual
```

Another type of function falls into the `write` category. In other programming languages, such functions are called setters. Such functions can modify the storage variables or reset the values in the hashmaps. 

Those transactions are the most gas expensive. The very fact that a function was called requires 21,000 gas. The cost becomes higher depending on the number and type of opcodes used in the function. Assigning a variable involves calling the `sstore` opcode, which costs 20,000 gas the first time the slot is accessed and 5,000 on every re-write.

The caller of the function pays the gas fees. The caller can be retrieved from the context of the function call, and inside the function can be accessed from `msg.sender`. If a function is payable, it is marked `payable,` and the sender has to attach some tokens with the call. This amount can be accessed via the function's `msg.value`.

In the standard implementation, there are usually five functions that an unprivileged user can call to change the storage:

```ts
// public   = can be called by anyone
// virtual  = allows its inheriting contracts to have a different implementation body
// override = a function with the same signature but different implementation

// Approving
1. function approve(address to, uint256 tokenId) public virtual override
2. function setApprovalForAll(address operator, bool approved) public virtual override

// Transferring
3. function transferFrom    (address from, address to, uint256 tokenId) public virtual override
4. function safeTransferFrom(address from, address to, uint256 tokenId) public virtual override
5. function safeTransferFrom(address from, address to, uint256 tokenId, bytes memory data) public virtual override
```

After looking at the function signatures above, it might seem that since anyone can call those functions, any user can approve or transfer someone else's NFTs to themselves. However, it is not the case. The function bodies have security mechanisms enabled before the token is approved or transferred. The built-in invokes this security mechanism `require` function. The function requires at least one parameter that should result in `true` or `false.` The second parameter is optional and is an error message string. If the condition in the first parameter resolves in false - all the transaction reverts, and no state change happens. The error message will populate the reason parameter to explain what went wrong to the user.

```ts
require(<condition>, "Error message");
```

The ERC-721 contract functions include require calls 18 times:

```ts
1. require(owner != address(0), "ERC721: address zero is not a valid owner");
2. require(owner != address(0), "ERC721: invalid token ID");
3. require(to != owner, "ERC721: approval to current owner");
4. require(
      _msgSender() == owner || isApprovedForAll(owner, _msgSender()),
      "ERC721: approve caller is not token owner or approved for all"
  );
5. require(_isApprovedOrOwner(_msgSender(), tokenId), "ERC721: caller is not token owner or approved"); // x2 times
6. require(_checkOnERC721Received(from, to, tokenId, data), "ERC721: transfer to non ERC721Receiver implementer");
7. require(
      _checkOnERC721Received(address(0), to, tokenId, data),
      "ERC721: transfer to non ERC721Receiver implementer"
  );
8. require(to != address(0), "ERC721: mint to the zero address");
9. require(!_exists(tokenId), "ERC721: token already minted");                         // x2 times
10. require(ERC721.ownerOf(tokenId) == from, "ERC721: transfer from incorrect owner"); // x2 times
11. require(to != address(0), "ERC721: transfer to the zero address");
12. require(owner != operator, "ERC721: approve to caller");                           // x2 times
13. function _requireMinted(uint256 tokenId) internal view virtual{                    // x2 times
      require(_exists(tokenId), "ERC721: invalid token ID");
    } 
```

## 1. Known NFT Attacks

<!-- https://github.com/Quillhash/NFT-Attack-Vectors -->

<!--

There are two major groups of NFT attacks:

1. Attacks on the user software
2. Social engineering attacks

### 1.1 Tech-related attacks

This group of attaks usually comprises frontend, backend or blockchain vulnerability exploits. 

### 1.1.1 Trojan Horse Gift NFTs

A user can get a gift NFT injected with [steganograhpy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steganography_tools). This attack can theoretically be implemented via all the media channels: text/code, image, video or audio. This type of attack can be used by the adversaries in two ways:

a. to hide malicious code that can be launched on a victim's machine
b. to extract and send sensitive data from the user's machine to the attacker's computer.

1. **Text steganography** can be injected in the smart contract code of the NFT presented to a user via a giveway or an pretend "erroneous" transfer to a "wrong" user.
2. In an **image steganography** attackers inject malicious JavaScript code in the image of the NFT which runs when the new Owner of the asset opens it in the browser. Bit or pixels, depending on the image format type, are invisibly replaced with malware code. There are several known types of tactics including `bit masking`, `filtering`, `pattern encoding` and `cosine transformation`.
3. In **Audio steganography** hackers usually exploit `WAV` files to conseal their malware.[^2]
4. Since a video file is a stream of images accompanied by audio technics 2 and 3 are used in **video steganography**.

**Preventing steganography:**

To prevent steganography there are `WEB3` and general cybersecurity mechanizms:

`WEB3` developers can deploy the NFT assets on immutable storage servers such as **IPFS** (Inter-Planetary File System) where the `CID` (Content ID) of the asset is a hash of its contents. As long as the content of the asset file results in the same hash using the same hashing algorithm, the file is authentic and its integrity is guaranteed. Unless the original collection creators injected their assets with malware, the NFT owner is safe.

In case NFTs include in-game assets sitting on centralised servers that are compromised, hackers can stuff the NFT assets with their malware and attack the collection owners once they view their assets in their browsers.

XP.NETWORK's **smart contract whitelisting** is one of the mitigation tools against NFT contracts containing malicious code trying to attack the users or the bridge.

Among traditional cyber security measures against steganograhpy can be:

1. **Remove all the structured metadata** that might compromise confidentiality or conseal trojans.
2. **Remove all unused data** making random noise at pixel level.
3. **Optimize the bitmap data** using a compression algorithm. It will automatically remove the unused bits that contained the malware.

Audio steganography seems to be used mostly to transfer secret information by hiding it in a public WAV file that anyone can hear, but only the designated recipients know how to extract the hidden data from the files.

### 1.2 Duplicate NFT Minting

Not everyone is equally tallented. Some 

### 1.3 Flash loan attacks

Flash loans allow borrowing incredibly high sums of money without a security collateral, but only within the same block. Inside this block, the tokens are transferred to the borrower's account the borrower uses it somewhere else and returns the total amount with a reward to the lender. Because everything happens so fast, such operations can only be executed by a smart contract deliberately written for each such manipulation. If hackers are highly knowledgeable and they spotted a potential for their attack, they usually use the flash loan to manipulate the demand / supply balance of the tokens of their interest, decreasing the value of the token of their interest within this block, immediately buy the undervalued assets at lower rates, maybe even resell them in other platforms where tha value has not been manipulated, earn profit and return the loan with the interest. NFTs can become part of the flow like it happened with the Ape coin[^3].

## 2. Social engineering attacks

### 2.1 Trap swaps

 Even though such applications like [Swap Kiwi](https://app.swap.kiwi/) can be [legitimate themselves](https://etherscan.io/address/0x18ddd8e16b0b0fb7679397c6e8f4ec06ea3f0a95#code), they can be used by scammers to trick owners of expencive (hundreds of thousands of USD worth) NFTs for worthles ones or miniscule amounts. Social engineering is out of our scope, because there is very little we can do when a legitimate owner selfhandedly transfers an asset to a thief.

Alternative attack involves adversary created websites mocking the famous ones where users are tricked to call the `approve` function in the NFT contract effectively making the contracts controlled by criminals legitimate `operators` of the asset. After that the criminals a free to transfer NFTs to themselves since they already have the original owner's permission.

The most popular NFT contract implementation by [Open Zeppelin](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/token/ERC721/ERC721.sol) stores the approvals in two mappings:

```ts
// Mapping from token ID to approved address
mapping(uint256 => address) private _tokenApprovals;

// Mapping from owner to operator approvals
mapping(address => mapping(address => bool)) private _operatorApprovals;
```

The functions responsible for setting approvals are the following:

```ts
function _approve(address to, uint256 tokenId) internal virtual {
  _tokenApprovals[tokenId] = to;
  emit Approval(ERC721.ownerOf(tokenId), to, tokenId);
}

function _setApprovalForAll(address owner, address operator, bool approved) internal virtual {
  require(owner != operator, "ERC721: approve to caller");
  _operatorApprovals[owner][operator] = approved;
  emit ApprovalForAll(owner, operator, approved);
}
```

Reading the approvals:

```ts
function getApproved(
    uint256 tokenId
) public view virtual override returns (address) {
  // Checks the NFT exists
  _requireMinted(tokenId);

  return _tokenApprovals[tokenId];
}

function isApprovedForAll(
  address owner, 
  address operator
) public view virtual override returns (bool) {
  return _operatorApprovals[owner][operator];
}
```

The approval record is automatically deleted when `burning` or `transferring` an asset:

```ts
function _burn(uint256 tokenId) internal virtual {
  // ... other code here
  // Clear approvals
  delete _tokenApprovals[tokenId];
  // ... other code here
}

function _transfer(address from, address to, uint256 tokenId) internal virtual {
  // ... other code here
  // Clear approvals from the previous owner
  delete _tokenApprovals[tokenId];
  // ... other code here
}
```

### 2.2 Impersonation scams

In this type of attack impersonaters pretend to be membres of the NFT collection creators, NFT marketplaces of crypto wallets. They hunt their prey in the support channels of the corresponding teams and suggest going private to help the users with their problem. In a private conversation they ask the users for their account credentials such as wallet seeds or private keys. If the victims believe the impersonators, they hand over the keys to their wallets and loose everything they had there.

### 2.3 NFT Team Rug Pulls

Some NFT project teams never plan to implement their promises to the community. They hype the collection by promising generous rewards to the asset owners and once they have collected enough money, they shut the project down and hide away from the public.

### 2.4 Recovery assistance scams

Once already scammed NFT owners start complaining and publicly reporting their scams they fall into the sphere of interest of yet another group of attackers. Their bots enfilter into hundreds of NFT communities and wait in an ambush untill a "wounded" victim starts "bleeding". The higher the cost of the lost asset, the more the victim is eager to pay for its recovery. The scammers claim to be highly proficient and have a long record of successful recoveries. They ask for advance payment and vanish after getting it. Sure enough, nobody is even trying to recover a stolen NFT.

### 2.5 Duplicate NFTs

Not everyone is equally talented to launch a successful project, design attractive NFTs and lucrative usecases for the NFT holders. Some choose to steal someone elses's work and mock other teams collections. They make their fake contracts and tokens look as similar as possible with the original ones. However an attentive eye can still spot the difference.

### 2.6 Fake trading activity

An NFT colleciton team uses several addresses they controll and purchase their NFTs via those accounts creating an impression of a high volume collection. Users outside the team may notice the trend and start buying those NFTs with a "good" history of sales at even higher prices. But, to their surprise, they cannot sell those NFTs to any other third parties.nIf the collection has no utility such as staking, farming or other benefits from holding an asset, the users how were the last to buy are left alone with their useless tokens.

### 2.7 Money Laundery NFT Trading

NFTs can be used for money laundering. A user can purchase a comparatively cheap NFT and then list it for an incredibly high price. Another user who is familiar with the first one of-line buys the token and transfers the amount without taxes, bank fees or notice of criminal police. Because the buyer's and the seller's accounts are anonimous such deals can hide bribery to public officials, payments to celebrities or other grey financial operations.

## How NFT contracts ensure CIA triad's best practices

CIA stands for Confidentiality, Integrity and  Availability. It is a convenient security model that helps build a consistent security policy around sensitive data.

1. **Confidentiality** is roughly synonimic to privacy. Sensitive data must be protected from unauthorised access. The sensitivity of data is usually measured by the potential damage its leakage can cause.
2. **Integrity** stands for accuracy, consistency and trustworthiness of data. Sometimes it is important that no third party has altered the data especially in a way that can cause damage to the legitimate users.
3. **Availability** means that the data must be readily accessible by the authorised or legitimate users.
