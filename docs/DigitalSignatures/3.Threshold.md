# Threshold Multisignature

The threshold signature is a subset of [Multisignature](./2.Multisignature.md). A unique public key represents each participant. However, each participant's private key is kept secret. The full secret is never disclosed. Each participant signs using their part of the secret share. Therefore, the original secret can never be reconstructed by an external party.

## FROST

A message or transaction will get through on condition that at least **$t$** out of **$n$** signers approve it. For example, if $n$ is ten signers and threshold $t$ is set to 0.7, at least seven participants must approve a transaction to go through, while three signers can stay inactive, down, or malicious.

An example of a Threshold Multisignature is FROST or Flexible Round-Optimized Schnorr Threshold Signature used since version 2.0 of the [XP.NETWORK NFT Bridge](https://bridge.xp.network/connect). 

FROST can be used in two forms:
1. A two-round Schnorr threshold signing protocol
2. A single-round protocol with preprocessing is an optimized version of the above, implemented by the XP.NETWORK NFT Bridge. 

Signing operations can be done concurrently (in parallel) without impacting security. The FROST protocol is considered secure if an adversary controls up to **$t-1$** signers.

Compared with other Schnorr based Threshold protocols, FROST looks fast (1 round of signing), is parallel secure, and requires at least $t$ signers. FROST is less finality robust than "Stinsol Strobl", should $n-t+1$ signers misbehave. It means that if malicious adversaries control enough signers that the benevolent ones can never reach the threshold, consensus will never be reached, and the transactions will not get through. For example, in a pool of ten signers with a threshold of 7 out of 10, if the adversaries control at least four signers, the threshold of 7 cannot be reached $10-4=6$.

## Schnorr quick recap

|Step|Signer|Exchange|Verifier|Explanation|
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
|1|$(x,Y)\leftarrow KeyGen()$|||SK[^1] = Private ($x$) &<br/>PK = public ($Y$[^2]) keys generation using a DKG Protocol[^3]|
|2||$\xleftarrow[]{\text(m,~ Y)}$||The verifyer wants a **message** $m$ to be signed|
|3|$k \leftarrow Z_q$|||A secret unique **nonce** is generated|
|4|$\mathbb{R} = g^k \in  \mathbb{G}$|||A **commitment** to the nonce is generated|
|5|$c = H(\mathbb{R}, Y, m)$|||A **challenge** is computed by hashing the commitment, PK, and the message|
|6|$z = k + c \times x$|||**Response** is the **nonce** plus the product of the **challenge** and the **SK**|
|7||$\xrightarrow[]{\text(m,\sigma = (\mathbb{R}, z))}$||The signed message as the **commitment** & the **response** are returned to the Verifier|
|8|||$c = H(\mathbb{R}, Y, m)$|The verifier claculates the **challenge**|
|9|||$\mathbb{R}' = g^z \times Y^{-c}$|The verifier derives the expected **commitment**|
|10|||$\mathbb{R}' \stackrel{?}{=} \mathbb{R}$|If the derived **commitment** matches the one from the signature, the signature is valid|

[^1]: The abbreviation $SK$ is often used to denote the private or **S**ecret **K**ey. While $PK$ is used to denote the **P**ublic **K**ey.

[^2]: $Y$ is a joint public key, while each signer holds a secret share $s_i$ and a public share $Y_i$. For example, private and public keys of the signers, generated with the elliptical curve cryptography, can be used as $s_i$ and $Y_i$.

[^3]: A DGK Protocol is an $n-wise$ SSS (Shamir Secret Sharing) protocol, where each participant is a dealer.

[^4]: Round Leaders are algorithmically elected in every round. It ensures leader rotations, eliminating a permanent signature aggregator in XP.NETWORK bridge by contrast with some other FROST implementations.

[^5]: The **binding factor** $\rho$ binds the shares to index $\ell$, the message $m$ and the commitments tuples $B$. This is the reason why FROST is secure against attacks.

[^6]: This step $d_i + (e_i \times \rho_i)$ cannot be inverted by an adversary who sees the response but does not know $(d_i, e_i)$

[^7]: The signature format & verification is identical to a single party Schnorr
