# Introduction

**Standards** are an agreement between people on how to do things. NFTs are a common crypto commodity traded on most of the blockchains that support smart contracts. Potentially standards make everybody's lives easier. All the products and tools could follow the "one-size-fits-all" principle.

In an ideal case, all the blockchains could agree upon one or several universal standards supported by the participants. It would become so much easier for the games, marketplaces, and metaverses to become cross-chain. It could reduce research and development costs. Developers could concentrate on business-related logic. Cross-chain projects would already be flourishing, boosting the chains' growth in geometrical progression.

However, we're not living in a perfect world, and many blockchains have chosen to develop their NFT standards. Sometimes they are conceptually close and require little effort to map one into another, but sometimes the standards are fundamentally different and require serious adapting one into another.

While building the bridge, we had to discover the differences and similarities between the standards and are happy to share this knowledge with the teams that might want to go cross-chain in the nearest future using our bridge.
