# Introduction

**Standards** are a agreement between people how to do things. NFTs are a common crypto commodity traded on most of the blockchains who support smart contracts. Potentially standards make everybody's lifes easier. All the products and tools could follow the "one-size-fits-all" principle.

In an ideal case all the blockchains could agree upon one or several universal standards supported by the participants wich would make it so much easier for the games, marketplaces and metaverses to become cross chain. It could reduce research and development costs. Developers could concentrate on the business related logic. Cross-chain projects would already be growing geometrically boosting the chains' growth.

However, we're not living a perfect world and many blockchain have chosen to develop their own NFT standards. Sometimes they are conceptually close and require little effort to map one into another, but sometimes the standards are fundamentally different and require serious adapting one into another.

While building the bridge we had to discover the differences and similarities between the standards and are happy to share this knowledge with the teams that migh want to go cross-chain in the nearest future using our bridge.
