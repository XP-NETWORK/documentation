  + **ERC721** Contains the main functionality of the contract
+ and the *optional* part
  + **ERC721Metadata** - ensures the main metadata fields (name, symbol. tokenUri)
  + **ERC721Enumerable** - allows querying the contract about the tokens and their owners
  + **ERC20-Compatibility** - allows for listing NFT in a way similar to FTs
