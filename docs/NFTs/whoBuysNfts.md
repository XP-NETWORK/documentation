# Who Buys NFTs

 According to Google Trends NFT Started to seriously interest people since the end of 2020 and peaked in January 2022[^1]. The first peak in 11 March 2021 was provoked by the Online Christie's Auction and the sale of an NFT minted on 16 February 2021 by a digital artist Mike Winkelmann better known as Beeple. The piece of art was called "EVERYDAYS: THE FIRST 5000 DAYS" and was purchased for unprecedented USD 69,346,250 [^2].
