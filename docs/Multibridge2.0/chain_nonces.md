# Internal Bridge Chain Nonces

To identify a target blockchain in an efficient way, we're using nonces or numbers used once since storing or processing an integer is more efficient than doing the same with a string. The list will keep growing as the new chains are integrated.

At the time of writing, the list of chain nonces are:
