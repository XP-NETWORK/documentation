## ⛩️ Bridges scale growth 📈
Without token bridges, **blockchains** are limited to their ecosystem. Assets cannot leave or enter the community boundaries. The bridge opens the gates for the "foreign goods," turning trade into "international" geometrically increasing the number of transactions with every bridged chain.

## ❓ Why NFTs 🪬
There's no question that trading cryptocurrencies is a lucrative business. However, tokens are only a means of payment for goods and services. While *Transaction fees* are the **native services** 🚖 of the blockchains that can be paid with FTs, they still need something other than tokenomics in itself to develop and thrive. 

Every economy needs goods to be traded to bring action and life into an ecosystem. *NFTs* are universal wrappers of ownership or access control rights to physical or virtual assets and therefore, are the most **natural goods** 🛍️ that can be bought and sold for fungible tokens and so for further development. Anything can be minted as an NFT in the crypto world: art, music, tickets, diplomas, certificates, licences, permits, ownership contracts of any kind, controll over IoT devices or AI entities and traded as derivaties.

## 🗺️ Globalizing Markets 🏪
Keeping all the NFTs at home means bounding them to the local ecosystem user base. Quickly increasing the demand for the goods whose life cycle is at its decline can be achieved by moving them to a *new market on another blockchain*. That is where our bridge comes into play.

## 🗃️ Collection's Product Life 🛒

There's no doubt that NFT Projects can easily prolong their collections' lives by bridging them to the other blockchains. But there's an alternative. The product's peak can be doubled or tripled by bridging parts of the collection to other environments and simultaneously launching on different chains using the base chain as proof of the collection's integrity.

## 🛖 Games 🏰
NFT-centered games can go cross-chain. That adds new, previously unavailable interaction to the game flow. NFT armies can invade the foreign kingdoms of the other chains. NFT explorers can travel in the parallel worlds of foreign chains and either return promoted with treasure and experience or be burned on the other sides of reality.

## 🔮 Metaverses 🪩
NFT guests can visit Metaverse locations on various chains and gain experience or earn tokens for completing complicated quests. Colledges and universities can open metaverse courses and lectures for NFT students from different chains and accept foreign ledger currencies as tuition.
