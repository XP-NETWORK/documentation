It is one of the possible domain name utilities. The domain names acan also be used as URL names of WEB-2 sites, as KYC IDs, as a convenient and easy to remember 

The domain names can be purchased or received for free as a part of the givaway campaign on the platforms of the [Unstoppable Domains's](https://unstoppabledomains.com/) partners.
