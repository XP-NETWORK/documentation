# XP.Network vs. Other NFT bridges

Let's begin our journey with a Google search. Usually, Google places the most relevant results at the top of the list, so let's go over the top 10 search results, because it is something a user unfamiliar with the existing bridging solutions would do.

1. The first on the list is GigLabs NFT Bridge. Unfortunately, at the time of this research, the site is not very informative, and it is hard to find any information about actual NFT bridging.

   However, on the LinkedIn page of the project, we can see that the project is a Launchpad and a CMC marketplace builder for Brand NFTs.

    The word combination "NFT Bridge" was considered trendy by the project, which, judging by the first position in the Google search, seems to have a good SEO marketing team. Unfortunately, the project has nothing to do with NFT bridging, at least at its current development stage.

2. The second place is occupied by a blog devoted to NFT "StacksBridge" launched in February 2022.

   The blog briefly outlines NFT Bridging in general, and besides, StacksBridge mentions the "Plasma" bridge connecting Polygon with Ethereum and the "Wormhole" bridge linking Solana with Ethereum. The StacksBridge bridge connects Ethereum with the Stacks blockchain and supports only one "Satoshibles" collection. A user is required to connect Metamask on the Ethereum side & Hiro Wallet with a Stacks account to be able to use the bridge.
