# XP.Network vs. Other NFT bridges

**TL;DR** video:

<ReactPlayer controls url='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOQr5mgt8K0' />

Let's begin our journey with a Google search phrase `nft bridge`. Usually, Google places the most relevant results at the top of the list. We will go over the top 10 search results because it is something a user unfamiliar with the existing bridging solutions would do.

Due to the rapidly changing nature of the industry, by the time you're reading this document, some of the tools or web resources may have changed or become non-existent. All the text below is relevant for August 2022 and is a snapshot of the current state of facts.

## 1. GigLabs NFT Bridge

The first on the list is GigLabs NFT Bridge. Unfortunately, at the time of this research, the site is not very informative, and it is hard to find any information about actual NFT bridging.

<center>

![2](/img/comparison/2.png)

</center>

   However, on the LinkedIn page of the project, we can see that the project is a Launchpad and a CMC marketplace builder for Brand NFTs.

    The word combination "NFT Bridge" was considered trendy by the project, which, judging by the first position in the Google search, seems to have a good SEO marketing team. Unfortunately, the project has nothing to do with NFT bridging, at least at its current development stage.

## 2. StacksBridge

The second place is occupied by a Jumpstart blog devoted to NFT `StacksBridge` launched in February 2022.
   
<center>

</center>

   The blog briefly outlines NFT Bridging in general, and besides, StacksBridge mentions the "Plasma" bridge connecting Polygon with Ethereum and the "Wormhole" bridge linking Solana with Ethereum. The StacksBridge bridge connects Ethereum with the Stacks blockchain and supports only the "Satoshibles" collection. A user is required to connect Metamask on the Ethereum side & Hiro Wallet with a Stacks account simultaneously to be able to use the bridge.

## 3. XP.NETWORK Multichain NFT Bridge

[XP.NETWORK Multichain NFT Bridge](https://bridge.xp.network/) occupies third place in the Google search rating. The bridge connects multiple EVM & Non-EVM chains, supports **NFT** & **SFT** transfers individually and in batches, adapts NFTs to 10+ token standards, and supports logic and collection name consistency on destination chains.

<center>

![6](/img/comparison/6.png)

</center>

[XP.Network](https://xp.network/) already connects 20+ blockchains, and the number is ever-growing.

Only one wallet at a time is required to use the bridge, the wallet relevant to the chain of origin.

The transaction fees on the chains of origin and destination are paid in the coins of the chain of origin by the NFT sender.

**No claiming, withdrawing, or fee payment** is required on behalf of the NFT receiver.

## 4. Plasma Bridge

`Plasma NFT Bridge` turned out to be in the fourth search position. The bridge allows ERC-721 & ERC-1155 token transfers between Polygon & Ethereum. Metamask and WalletConnect are allowed for transaction signatures. A user must provide a collection address on the chain of departure and the receiver's address on the destination chain. The contracts on the chain of departure and destination must be mapped by the project's team for a successful transaction.

<center>

![8](/img/comparison/8.png)

## 6. Portal (Wormhole) Bridge

Google offers a link to `Portal (Wormhole) Bridge`. The bridge connects 11 EVM chains with Solana. It combines fungible and non-fungible token transfers. However, SFTs are not supported. Users can sign their transactions via nine wallets.

## 7. Palm NFT Bridge

The `NFT Bridge Palm` Connects Ethereum & Palm networks. The only supported wallet is Metamask. There are a dozen collections whitelisted on the bridge.

## 8. LeewayHerz NFT Swap

The eighth position on the search list was given to a blog of Leeway Herz, a founder and CEO of the company bearing his name. The blog author offers a concept of an NFT trade-in or simply swapping NFTs that started losing their popularity and value for other NFTs, crypto, or a combination of NFTs & crypto.

The project does not offer a bridging solution but promotes its software development solutions for blockchains, Metaverses, IoT devices, AI, and NFT Marketplaces.

## 9. AllianceBlock Bridge

The ninth position is occupied by a Media blog featuring the second version of `AllianceBlock NFT Bridge`. The blog outlines FT and NFT bridging in general and informs the reader about the new features of the 2.0 version of the bridge such as reducing the time of transfer and paying for the transactions in the native tokens.

<center>

![13](/img/comparison/13.png)

</center>

The bridge found zero out of 3 NFTs on BSC and zero out of 17 on Polygon. It was able to locate one out six on Ethereum, though. Maybe NFT collections require whitelisting to become available for transfer. The only supported wallet is Metamask which is ok because all the integrated EVM chains are Metamask friendly.

## 10. Wormhole NFT Bridge Documentation

At the tenth position, Google brought the Wormhole bridge's docs page devoted to the NFT Bridge. 

The document seems to be obsolete and contains self-contradictions. The first utterance claims that NFT bridging is implemented on three chains, while six chains are listed immediately below the statement.

NFTs bridging is opposed to "normal tokens" bridging. The document's author is unfamiliar with SFTs and claims that amount is irrelevant for an NFT bridge. 

The document only mentions the ERC-721 NFT standard, while ERC1155 and standard variations such as ERC-721A or ERC-1155D are ignored.
