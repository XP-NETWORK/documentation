# Signing the bridging transaction

The Sender of the NFT(s) pays for the transactions on the local and the target chains in the native currency. It is very convenient for the payer. The bridge takes the burden of exchanging the coins in the background providing a smooth user experience. 

The local and the foreign transaction fees are shown separately in the wallet for the clarity of the signer. The native chain gas fees are withdrawn by the blockchain to award the validators for their work. The foreign chain fees are collected by the bridge smart contract for reimbursing the costs of the bridge oracles, who pay in the target chain coins for submitting the bridge transactions.
